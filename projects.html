    <h3>Creation of Website pages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Car rental Website using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript</strong></p>
      <p>Developed a full-stack car rental website demonstrating progressive web development 
        skills. Implemented responsive front-end pages using HTML and CSS, 
        added client-side validation and interactivity with JavaScript, 
        and integrated PHP and MySQL for server-side data storage and retrieval. Find 
      here is the link to the project report after completion:

      <li><p><strong>Online Convenient Store using HTML, CSS, Java, MongoDB, Github repository, and JavaScript</strong></p>
      <p>This was actually a group project consisted of three members, we created an online store using 
        HTML, CSS, Java, MongoDB, Github repository, and JavaScript. The project involved 
        designing a user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS, implementing backend functionality 
        with Java, and utilizing MongoDB for database management. The project was collaboratively 
        managed using GitHub for version control and team coordination. There was a frontend and backend. 
        The features/functions of the website are the analytics page,receipt page, payment page and
        transaction history page. Here is the link to the 
        project report after completion and also a demo video of the project done by our team:

    <h3>Embedded Systems & Low-level Programming</h3>
    <ul>
      
      <li><p><strong>Embedded Systems & Low-level Programming</strong></p>
        <p>Created a embedded system using the microcontroller (FRDM-K20D50M), LEDs,potentiometer. 
          The project involved programming the microcontroller to read input from the potentiometer 
          and control the lightings of the LEDs accordingly. This project demonstrated my skills in 
          low-level programming, hardware interfacing, and real-time system design.

      <li><p><strong>Creating a TicTacToe Game using Embedded Systems</strong></p>
      <p>It was a group project consisting of three members. We work together to create a TicTacToe game using FRDM-K20D50M microcontroller,
        a LCD display, 4x4 Keypads and a buzzer. The buzzer is used to signal the winner of the game and button sounds.
        The LCD display is used to display the current state of the game board. The 4x4 keypad is used to input player moves.
         The game of TicTacToe is to played between two players
      where each player takes turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the game board. The winner is the 
      player who can get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. Find here is the link to the project video demo:

      <li><p><strong>SolidWorks Designing</strong></p>
        <p>Created a 3D printed model using SolidWorks. The project involved designing a 3D printed model using SolidWorks.
          This project demonstrated my skills in 3D modeling, design for manufacturing, and technical drawing. 
          Also using Soliworks simulation to find out which material is appropriate for the 3D model design.
          In terms of the material selection, to test the amount of stress on the model, and has good mechanical properties, 
          making it suitable for functional prototypes and end-use parts.

        </li>
      <li><p><strong>Gearbox Design using SolidWorks</strong></p>
        <p>It was a group project where we designed a functional gearbox using SolidWorks. The project involved creating detailed 3D models of the gearbox components, 
          assembling them, and performing FEA simulations to analyze performance under various conditions. The main objective was to design
          the perfect gear ratio for the gearbox to ensure optimal performance to lift a 2KG load to a height of 1.5meter.
          This project showcased my proficiency in mechanical design, kinematics, and CAD software.
          Unfortunately, there is no link to the project report. But there is a video demo of the project:
