    <p>
      <strong>Hi, my name is John Baptist Matambuai JAVAPRO.</strong>
      I am from Papua New Guinea and I am currently a fourth-year double-degree
      student in <strong>Computer Science (Software Development)</strong> and
      <strong>Robotics/Mechatronics Engineering</strong> at
      <strong>Swinburne University of Technology</strong>. My program has required
      me to balance advanced engineering mathematics with core software development
      concepts, strengthening my analytical thinking, adaptability, and technical depth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this journey, I have developed strong problem-solving skills and a
      disciplined approach to learning complex systems. My prior work experience
      has further strengthened my communication, teamwork, and reliability. As I
      prepare for my final year, I am seeking opportunities where I can apply my
      software and technical skills while continuing to grow as a professional.
