    <h3>Designing Controllers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Digital Control and Pendulum Balancing Project</strong>
      <p>It was a group work where we designed and implemented digital controllers using MATLAB, Simulink, 
        and QUARC for a servo-driven rotary pendulum system. The project involved 
        modelling continuous and discrete-time control systems with zero-order hold,
         analysing step responses, and designing lead compensators for improved transient
          performance. A full state-space model of the rotary pendulum was derived using 
          Euler–Lagrange dynamics, linearised, and validated through controllability 
          analysis. State-feedback gains were calculated using pole 
          placement to meet specified performance criteria (overshoot and settling time),
           and the controller was successfully deployed on Quanser QUBE-Servo 3 hardware to
            achieve real-time pendulum balancing. The effects of sampling time on digital 
            control performance were also analysed and evaluated.

      <li><strong>Designing PID Controllers</strong>
      <p>Completed a control systems assignment focused on designing and tuning PID and 
        lead/lag controllers using MATLAB for robotic and aircraft control applications. 
        The work involved modelling dynamic systems, selecting controller parameters to meet 
        performance requirements such as low overshoot, fast settling time, and minimal 
        steady-state error, and analysing system responses through simulation. 
        Multiple controller designs were evaluated and compared to verify stability, 
        damping, and tracking performance, demonstrating practical controller design 
        skills for real-world robotic and aerospace systems.</p>

      <li><strong>Magnetic Levitation (MATLAB & Control Systems)</strong>
      <p>Analysed and modelled a nonlinear magnetic levitation (Maglev) system using MATLAB. Linearised the nonlinear dynamics 
        about an equilibrium point, derived the plant transfer function, and evaluated system stability using root locus techniques. 
        Designed and compared P, PD, and PID controllers through simulation and experimental testing, analysing step responses, 
        stability, accuracy, and transient performance. Demonstrated practical understanding of controller effects on nonlinear 
        systems and real-world validation through laboratory experiments.</p>

    <h3>Using Logisim Software & ARMLite Simulator</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Using Logisim Software to create Digital STOPWATCH</strong></p>
      <p>
        Developed a fully functional digital stopwatch using Logisim, implementing start/stop, 
        reset, seconds, minutes, and features. Designed modular circuits using logic 
        gates, flip-flops (JK, D, T, SR), counters, splitters, LEDs, buttons, and hex digit 
        displays to ensure accurate timekeeping and proper interface interaction. 
        Each stage was documented, tested, and verified, demonstrating practical 
        skills in digital logic design, circuit implementation, and problem-solving.

      <li><p><strong>Using Assembly Language to create a Simple adding subtracting Game in Web-based ARMLite Simulator</strong></p>
      <p>
        Developed a fully functional Matchsticks game in ARM assembly, implementing a single-player vs computer mode 
        with alternating turns, input validation, and game logic to determine wins, losses, or draws. The project used 
        ARMlite functions, arrays, and random number generation, progressively built in stages to handle player input, 
        matchstick counting, and game state updates. The final version incorporated a graphical display of remaining matchsticks,
        demonstrating skills in assembly programming, algorithm design, and creative interface implementation.

    <h3>Website Security</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Secure Web Deployment with Chained Certificates</strong></p>
      <p>Implemented a HTTPS website secured by a certificate chain signed by a trusted root authority, 
        ensuring the browser recognized it as secure with a green padlock. Created an 
        Intermediate Certificate Authority (CA), generated the web server certificate, 
        and chained it with the intermediate certificate for deployment on Apache. 
        Verified secure communication using Wireshark and configured browser trust by 
        installing the root certificate. This project demonstrated skills in certificate 
        management, web server configuration, encryption verification, and secure system 
        deployment.</p>

    <h3>PLC Programming</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>What is a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)?</strong></p>
      <p>A PLC is a specialised industrial computer used to control machines and automated 
        processes. It reads inputs from sensors and switches, processes them using a control 
        program, and then controls outputs such as motors, valves, and actuators. PLCs are 
        designed to be reliable, fast, and robust, making them ideal for use in factories, 
        production lines, and automated systems like pick-and-place mechanisms.</p>
        <p><strong>Pick-and-Place PLC Programming</strong></p>
      <p>
        The PLC program controls a pick-and-place mechanism using a step-by-step sequence. 
        It starts when the operator presses the start button, moves the arm to the pick 
        position, lowers it to grab the object using a vacuum gripper, then lifts and 
        moves the object to the place position. After releasing the object, the system 
        returns to its home position and waits for the next cycle. Sensors are used at 
        each stage to confirm positions, ensuring safe, accurate, and reliable operation.
